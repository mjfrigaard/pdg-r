# Overview 

Iteration solves many common problems we encounter in data workflows. This tutorial covers the basics of iteration in R, starting with using `for` loops, their structure, designing your loops for optimal performance, and debugging errors. We also cover the tidyverse package for iteration, `purrr`, which uses functionals (a `tidyverse` equivalent to `for` loops). 

## Use cases for iteration 

- Problems that iteration solves

- DRY principle

## `for` loops

  - `for` loop structure (output, sequence, body)

  - output

  - sequence

  - body

## `purrr` functions

- `map()` (and variants)

- `walk()` & `walk2()`

- `pmap()`, `imap()`, etc.

## Worked examples 

- Export/import multiple datasets

- Downloading files from the web
